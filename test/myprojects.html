		<h3><strong>Key-Pad Lock<strong></h3>
		<img src = "./../images/digital-logic.png">
		<h3><strong>What is the project about?</strong></h3>
		<p>This is the project from the Digital Logic CPRE 281 class.
		   It is going to use the logic gates, Verilog to make a door lock design.</p>

		<h3><strong>Identify the project</strong></h3>
		<p>This is quite normal concept in my living environment in my country.
		I had used digital door lock since 2002.
		This project consisted of using Verilog to design various circuits.<br>
		We can not only use the circuits diagrams but also use the code from the Verilog. </p>

		<h3><strong>Describe the project</strong></h3>
		<p>The project is pretty simple that save the password of key pad lock, and reset it.
		There are several steps that below. </p>

		<ul>
			<li> Unlock door after a 4 digit password has been entered using push buttons,
			 e.g., the push buttons pressed one at a time and in this order 1,2,3, and 4 would result in a code of 1234.  </li>
			<li> Lock indicates the current entered code on 4 7-seg displays. Non-entered digits should not display any number. </li>
			<li> Lock checks code after the 4th button has been pressed and clears current entered code. </li>
			<li> Lock keeps track of incorrect attempts. </li>
			<li> Lock indicates when it is locked, unlocked, locked until hard reset, and entering in a new code. </li>
			<li> After hard reset, the code is 1111, and number of incorrect attempts is 0. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3><strong>Identify Skills</strong></h3>
		<p>  The skills were that we learned from lectures. However, everything that I learned from lecture was all new for me.
		I learned what is the C languages, Verilog, and digital logic circuit design.
		 I feel like this skills that I did during the final project will be used throughout my career.
		 If I am design the computer simple hardware in the future, this skills will help me to reduce not only the price of the hardware design but also control the CPU.
